# Starter Project for Phaser 3 and Facebook Instant Games using TypeScript

### The dist folder includes the latest build in bundle.zip that includes Facebook diagnostics and which can be uploaded straight to Facebook and tested. There are plenty of colourful console outputs which are temporarily enabled in production build mode which you can see when playing through Facebook.

## Introduction
A TypeScript webpack project that includes the phaser library in its output. Base build size is ~700KB. Facebook Instant Games SDK is available when loaded in the browser. The SDK is followed closely when implementing it in TypeScript.

The aim of the project is to create a quicker entry to development using these libraries and exploiting them as much as possible.

The project includes the ability to test the game in development and production environments to account for Facebook's availability. Be aware that Facebook Instant Games SDK won't be available in development mode, this is already handled for you.

### Phaser 3
Phaser 3 is a great free open source game engine which makes use of the native HTML5 elements and will work in the browser whether it supports WebGL or the simpler Canvas.

It has many great examples covering all aspects of development at: [Phaser 3 Examples](http://labs.phaser.io/)

### Facebook Instant Games
Facebook Instant Games functionality is only testable once your game is being hosted on the Facebook servers. It was important to check where the game was being hosted before attempting to integrate the Facebook Instant Games SDK script into any game code.

## How to get started
### Clone
You can clone or download this and use it as you wish and help improve it.

### Install Packages
```
npm install
```
Install all the packages specified in package.json

### Run Development Server with Webpack
```
npm run dev
```
Visit localhost:8080

### Build for Production
```
npm run build
```
Output is bundle.js in dist folder

The contents of dist folder can be compressed and uploaded to Facebook Instant Games Hosting and tested
* this includes index.html aswell as assets folder and bundle.js

## How to Test/Publish on Facebook for Developers
### 1) Setup App with Facebook
* Create a new App on Facebook for Developers
* Add 'Instant Games' Product

### 2) Upload to Facebook
* Build Game for Production or continue by using bundle.zip
* Compress contents of dist folder into .zip or .7z format
* Browse .zip or .7z file to Instant Games->Web Hosting section
* Enter a description in the about this version... section
* Upload
* Select the uploaded bundle and click the star 'Push to Production'

### 3) Test the Game on Facebook Messenger App
* When the app is uploaded it can be tested on Facebook Messenger App where your app will be under 'Games->In development'
* You can also share the app with yourself and play it on the browser, as well as get console output for diagnostics.

## Built with
### Development Dependencies
* [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) - Development server
* [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) - Production build bundler
* [webpack-merge](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack-merge) - Webpack config merger
* [webpack-cli](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/uglifyjs-webpack-plugin) - Webpack command line interface
* [uglifyjs-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/uglifyjs-webpack-plugin) - Production build pipeline
* [typesript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) - Scalable JavaScript
* [phaser typings](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-docs/tree/master/typescript) - Typings for Phaser 3 (optional)

### Production Dependencies
* [phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) - Game engine (part of bundle)

### Other
* [Facebook Developers Instant Games SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/games/instant-games/sdk) - FBInstant made available by index.html (not part of bundle)

## What Works
* Development environment without Facebook being available ✓
* Building a production build and packaging it to play through Facebook ✓
* Fetching player name and photo ✓
* Loading progress of game tied into Facebook ✓
* Phaser scene management including menu, game and pause scenes ✓

## Feature Requests
* Typings for Facebook Instant Games SDK to remove some of the guesswork when using it
* Cleaner interface between the game and scoring mechanisms to make integration with Facebook much nicer
* Tests, currently there are no tests but the functions should be simple enough to only accomplish one thing which they do
* Anyone with some imagination will be able to improve this starter project, to make it easier for others starting out using this workflow
* As with all game systems, a nice state management infrastructure goes a long way :)
